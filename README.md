# Technical Assessment

## :scroll: Description
This is an app totally written in Kotlin with TDD (Test Driven Development) approach. I created a game called Tic Tac Toe with three final possibilities: x wins, o wins and draw. I committed almost every steps I went through to reach the final solution. That's helpful to understand my way of thinking. I focused also on scalability and MVVM design pattern, by modifying row and column variable in MainActivity, you can get this game of 3x3 , 5x5 as well as 10x10 as long as row should equal to column, this is only one restrict.

To compile and run this code you just need Android Studio and its simulator or a real Android device.

minSdkVersion 17 and targetSdkVersion 30
