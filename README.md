# Technical Assessment

## :scroll: Description
This is an app totally written in Kotlin with TDD (Test Driven Development) approach. I created a game called Tic Tac Toe with three final possibilities: x wins, o wins and draw. I committed almost every steps I went through to reach the final solution. That's helpful to understand my way of thinking.

To compile and run this code you just need Android Studio and its simulator or a real Android device.
